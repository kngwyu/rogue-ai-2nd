# rogue-ai-2nd
It's my rogue AI.  
It's in early development stage and not so strong.  
I uploaded some plays of this AI in [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/~kngwyu).

# How to run
First, you have to install rogue 5.4.4 from [my repo](https://github.com/kngwyu/rogue5.4.4) or your distro's package manager.  
Then, 
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/kngwyu/rogue-ai-2nd.git
./run.py
```

To check detailed options, run
``` shell
cargo run -- --help
```
